Welcome back to the blog! 

Before I get started I'd like to thank our supporter Jonathan for his help funding the blog and keeping us ad-free, thanks!

I have definitely found myself surprised in the past to find that some people in my following either actively like or don't understand my disdain for parking lots, this post is for you! I will explain in detail why I (and plenty of other transit lovers and urbanists) have such a dislike for parking lots.

That being said I will also take a look at parking from a pragmatic point of view in order to hopefully show (much as I did with cars) how we can minimize the harm it does and perhaps even create some pleasant solutions!

So lets go!

## Why surface parking is bad . . .

Surface parking is something which to this day despite being talked about a lot even in non urbanist circles is one of the worst things about the way North American cities are laid out. I am going to spare you the complaints about wide streets and other things cars influence and mention that even on a narrow street, surface parking can easily double or in some case triple or quadruple the distance it takes to walk from one side of a street to a shop or store on the other side.

In the worst cases, these wide parking lots, which often exist at malls and big box stores feature simply the maximum allowable density of cars. This means they usually lack pedestrian pathways, leaving people to walk through the crowded grid of cars, risking being hit - this also makes parking lots incredibly difficult if not at times impossible to navigate for those with mobility issues. There also tends to be a lack of any greenery which leads to parking lots instantly just making an urban environment feel very bleak, dead, and cold. Of course the lack of vegitation leads to another set of problems from an environmental perspective, when it rains or when snow melts there is much less surface for the water to drain through, this leads to issues with storm runoff for whole cities as well as the potential for localized flooding, and when its not raining the large often dark colored surface absorbs and releases heat incredibly effectively which can be a huge if not primary factor in the urban heat island effect in many places which leads to cities being hotter than surrounding undeveloped areas.

Beyound just the inconvenience, and environmental issues parking lots have other big issues in terms of their encouraging of car use. By separating destinations people want to travel to from the actual places where poeple live large parking lots can necessitate people using cars to cover vast distances, they also as I mentioned before generally force pedestrians and transit uses to walk through a vast area of parked vehicles to go almost anywhere, an effect which much like the presence of transit on streets is likely to influence how someone thinks about mobility.

However perhaps for what I find the most egregious issue with surface parking, the inefficiency and waste of space. First of all, car parking is often empty for much of the day, and while if you have a bus being used to feed people into a retail or commercial complex you can park it at night on some low value industrial land, parking lots literally require a constant commitment to car storage even when they often remain largely empty for much of the day and week. Furthermore, a few bus services which require the space of only about 5 parked cars for stops and nice amenities can deliver orders of magnitude more people to a destination. Now of course some may argue that with big box stores and things like furniture, or large applicances, or even giant grocery shopping trips parking lots conveniently allow consumers to load up a large SUV or truck which has sadly become the default vehicle in much of North America. The truth is that this way of distributing materials and any type of large item is incredible inefficient. Why have everyone own a delivery vehicle when a small number of businesses who actually need a large vehicle all day (and can afford a more efficient and modern purpose built vehicles) could.

## Is better parking possible?

If you have gotten this far your first answer is probably, parkades! I will be totally honest, while parkades are also bad in there own ways, especially when underground as they are incredibly expensive to construct and because parkades require an investment that leads to anyone paying for one having a major vested interest in car use, they do fix a number of the problems with traditional surface parking lots.

Working backwards one of the first benefits of parkades is space efficiency, unlike a surface parking lot which inherently is likely to have a big footprint, a parkade can be many levels tall or underground in both cases reducing if not eliminating the issue of a large space between roadways and actual destinations. Parkades also do provide a better experience to drivers who get the benefit of weather protection both for themselves and their vehicles, as well as enhanced security. Furthermore, parkades can *often* mesh better with a dense cityscape than a surface parking lot whose large flat open space sticks out a lot more; parkades can even be wrapped in interesting materials even including things such as green walls and solar panels which can work to offset their environmental and air quality impacts. Of course, even better with a parkade is that since it is an enclosed space and a fully constructed structure there should be more of a push for EV use within them, both because EV's do not have a major impact on air quality particularly underground but, also because installing charging infrastructure upon construction and then using charging either as a way to make revenue on a structure or to draw EV owners in is a nice option if executed well (providing a significant portion of stalls for EV exclusive use).

Of course, parkades have there own issues as I mentioned before, but I do want to touch on just a few more of them. For one, if a surface lot encourages car use, a parkade with more convenience built in and with massive capacity in a small space can easily make the problem of too many cars worse. Theres also arguably a negative in the fact that once you have built a parkade you are much more likely to let it sit there long term than say replace it with more commercial or residental space as some developers do with underutilized parking lots down the road. But, honestly my number one issue is price - parkades are an expensive and clear investment in automobile infrastructure than has a lasting impact in mobility and land use patterns that cannot quickly be changed and for that just like with surface parking lots they are problematic.
