# reecemartin.github.io

A personal website open for use by myself and others.

# What is the site?

The purpose of this site is to provide a resume/portfolio like presentation of my skills, achievements and interests, largely for purposes of sharing. However this site is also a place for me to try deploying and testing some frontend and web technologies 
for personal practice. 

I also feature some small demo features one of which is based on work in another one of my Github repositories.

## New Personal Website Project

One big project I am currently planning is a total revamp of my personal website using React and a nice functional organization model. Ideally this will significantly simplify expansion and modification of my website in the future with plug and play components. In addition this will be an oppurtunity to clean up and beautify the site with a new layout and updated content.

### Update December 5 - 2019

The new personal website project is coming along nicely, I have replaced the navigation at the top of the page with nicely styled components courtesy of Material UI (https://material-ui.com/). I have also created both single and multi-picture components which have integrated styling and text functionality which will be a great asset in creating an attractive new bio website. 

### Update December 6 - 2019

The new navigation at the top of the screen is already growing on me but, ugh it doesn't look very good on mobile (see below).

As you can see things look pretty nice on Desktop but, on mobile we have this.
