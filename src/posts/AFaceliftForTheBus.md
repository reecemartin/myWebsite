Welcome back to the Website, today we are going to be talking about how to get people onto buses and how to keep them there. This is a super important topic so I hope you'll read through carefully, buses are the backbone of some of the worlds best performing transit systems (for ridership) including in North America where I will likely pull a number of examples from the TTC in Toronto and Translink in Vancouver. Let's get started. 

## The Fundamentals

When writing a post like this about buses, I think one of the main target countries for improvement is the United States. In the U.S. buses tend to be highly stigmatized for being slow, crowded and dirty. However, the main problem for buses [really comes down to frequency](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-torontos-secret-success-suburban-buses/) 

In many places in the U.S. hourly bus service is the norm with 30-minute services being considered frequent, this contrasts quite starkly to Vancouver where Translink defines the frequent transit network as those routes which operate every 15-minutes or better for most of the day, or to Toronto where the TTC's frequent network is literally called the 10-minute network. 

The problem with these low frequencies is multifaceted but, some core points include . . . 

- Much longer travel times as a potential 15-30 minute average wait time must be factored into a trip, this compounds on each transfer making longer trips using multiple buses even less attractive.
- Much less flexibility, riders are much more likely to be anxious about missing a bus or needing to remember a timetable and they cannot easily take an unplanned trip.
- Reduces the street presence of transit which I think is an understated benefit of frequent service, [somewhat like what I talked about with EV chargers](https://www.reecemartin.ca/posts/WhyIDonthatecars/), people seeing buses reminds them that its a good option.


## So Buses with Fancy Seats?

Unfortunately, the approach often taken by transit agencies in the United States is to try to add gimmicks and frills to buses in order to encourage ridership. Unfortunately this rarely seems to work at attracting New riders since fundamentally they do not increase what is otherwise a very inconvenient services' convenience. Well I may be skeptical of cars and I do think they have many negatives it's undeniable that at least the perception of being able to go somewhere at any time is incredibly powerful so I really think without offering something that kind of competes with that you're going to struggle to attract many riders when a seemingly much more convenient and freeing option is available. that means it's kind of my belief that you have to offer similar flexibility to cars to draw people away from them. offering frequencies around every 10 minutes would be a great way to achieve this, this compounds with another fairly well-known effect which is that people tend to perceive the ability to go somewhere immediately as more important than travel time to an extent this means that sometimes people will take a longer transit Journey if it means they can get an earlier departure time.
