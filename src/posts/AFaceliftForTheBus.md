Welcome back to the Website, today we are going to be talking about how to get people onto buses and how to keep them there. This is a super important topic so I hope you'll read through carefully, buses are the backbone of some of the worlds best performing transit systems (for ridership) including in North America where I will likely pull a number of examples from the TTC in Toronto and Translink in Vancouver. Let's get started. 

## The Fundamentals

When writing a post like this about buses, I think one of the main target countries for improvement is the United States. In the U.S. buses tend to be highly stigmatized for being slow, crowded and dirty. However, the main problem for buses [really comes down to frequency](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-torontos-secret-success-suburban-buses/) 

In many places in the U.S. hourly bus service is the norm with 30-minute services being considered frequent, this contrasts quite starkly to Vancouver where Translink defines the frequent transit network as those routes which operate every 15-minutes or better for most of the day, or to Toronto where the TTC's frequent network is literally called the 10-minute network. 

The problem with these low frequencies is multifaceted but, some core points include . . . 

- Much longer travel times as a potential 15-30 minute average wait time must be factored into a trip, this compounds on each transfer making longer trips using multiple buses even less attractive.
- Much less flexibility, riders are much more likely to be anxious about missing a bus or needing to remember a timetable and they cannot easily take an unplanned trip.
- Reduces the street presence of transit which I think is an understated benefit of frequent service, [somewhat like what I talked about with EV chargers](https://www.reecemartin.ca/posts/WhyIDonthatecars/), people seeing buses reminds them that its a good option.


## So Buses with Fancy Seats?

I'm sure you're wondering or screaming at your monitor if you are a cycling advocate, why not just bike? Well that is a good question . . . as it turns out distances were long enough that even cycling could take some time, but it wasn't necessarily impractical. Unfortunately a bigger issue was the lack of cycling infrastructure and speeding cars. No bike lanes, bike racks, and any destination cycling facilities made it unattractive as an option. Being able to get to a bus that wasn't very useful faster also wasn't that enticing.

## The unfortunate reality

While I am a huge advocate of transit, cycling and walking; there are a number of issues with them being practical purely based on distances in a lot of rural areas. Of course, there is lots we can work on to make rural areas and suburbs more sustainable but, don't forget that with limited dollars for transit we are limited in what we can do, and low hanging fruit from a population coverage and service quality perspective should generally be prioritized. This does leave us with a problem though, despite the trend to urbanization I think a significant amount of the population of North America is and continues to be poorly served by transit. We also have a massive sunk investment in a lot of car infrastructure (some of which can and should be converted into dedicated transitways and bike lanes). 

All this being said even if we had the money I feel at least in North America it would be a long time before significant transit service and infrastructure made sense in a *lot* of suburbs. Plus, even if we decided to do something like that we are facing issues such as climate change that cannot wait for such a drastic shift to occur.

## A pragmatic solution

So while transit and improved urban design (reducing distance to services and commercial areas) can play a large role, the reality is that North America has tons of cars and car infrastructure now and I think a policy of *harm reduction* is likely the best policy, so how do we do that . . .?

### First, reduce car use on the whole

Policies like carbon and congestion pricing can help reduce car use and push drivers to use smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles. Congestion pricing can be targeted to push riders to use transit in core areas, and similar pricing can and should be applied to parking. You can also encourage those who are not directly served by high quality transit to drive to a park and ride site. Of course this is not ideal but, on the whole it reduces miles driven so I do see it as an improvement as long as you don't encourage more of the development that requires car parking at transit hubs. [See GO Transit in Ontario]([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-go-transit-calls-time-on-free-parking/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-go-transit-calls-time-on-free-parking/))

### Second, reduce the numbers for the worst types of private vehicles

Trucks and suvs which have become increasingly popular in North America take up more space when parked, emit more GHG's, damage the road more due to increased weight, and are a lot more dangerous for everyone due to a higher center of gravity and their large size. Reducing trucks and suvs could be done with a number of different policies. 

### Third, discourage car use during peak hours as with transit

Private and commercial vehicle traffic causing congestion makes road networks less effective for more efficient modes of transport like cycles and buses during peak hours and so just as with peak hour pricing on transit, road pricing can be adaptive to encourage use off peak. This can apply to parking as well.

### Fourth, reduce the impact of existing cars

A number of measures can help reduce the environmental impact of existing cars and road. These include:

- Policies which push for regular maintenance to maximize efficiency
- Carpooling and HOV lanes
- Keeping cars running longer by expanding regulation and technical standards
- Encourage the use of Hybrids
- Smart road network policies that strike a balance between reducing congestion and inducing demand
- Move to more permeable pavement and reduce run off from parking and roads
- Modify pavements to reduce the urban heat island effect

### Fifth, aggressively convert to electric cars both privately and for commercial use 

Electric vehicles are incredibly interesting to me and now living in BC I can really see how smart policies can encourage their use, BC has:

- Provided significant provincial subsidies, including extra subsidy for removing ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles from the road permanently
- Removed subsidies for *luxury* electric vehicles
- Expanded EV charging networks in population centers and along major highways to significantly reduce range anxiety
- Providing decals so EV users can use HOV lanes
- Provided subsidies to residents and business owners to install chargers
- Worked with BC Hydro (provincial electric utility) to promote EVs

I want to make a special note of points 2,3, and 5 here. By creating policies with a clear *visual* impact, more potential people can start to think about EVs, this is particularly important for charging which is often a particular concern to ICE drivers (despite the fact most charging will happen at home anyway). Having utilities involved is also very useful as in the long term, the significant battery capacity of EVs connected to the electrical grid could provide significant stability benefits, especially as solar and wind power grow in prominence.

## Conclusion

I am by no means a car lover, however I do think we need to be practical when reducing the harm cars do. Smart policies and regulation are far more likely to be implemented and effective than simple suggestions of "banning all cars". I do plan on talking more about urban mobility, urban planning and electric vehicles in the future so stay tuned to the channel and the site for more.
