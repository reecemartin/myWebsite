Welcome back to the Website, today we are going to be talking about my channel's restart and how YouTube (at least my channel) actually requires a ton of work and management effort!

This post will attempt to detail why I did not just relaunch my channel immediately, some details of my YouTube channel that may not have been public, as well as some of the work that goes in behind the scenes to provide excellent regular transit content.

## Changes to the Equipment

Now, if you have watched my YouTube channel for a while, you'll know that I take great pleasure in talking about electronics - especially computers and cameras. Now, while I am certainly passionate about technology just for technology's sake (a big reason why I did my undergrad in Computer Science), the channel and my videos are also a big reason. You see, when producing YouTube videos, there are two things that are absolutely musts: the visual fidelity of the video (largely dependent on the camera), and the speed at which I can edit and export (largely dependent on the computer).

With the channel relaunch underway, I am making some strategic upgrades to my computer such that I can better edit content, this comes in the form of: 

- Upgrading my CPU from a Ryzen 9 3900X (12 core - 24 thread) to a Ryzen 9 3950X (16 core - 32 thread). Upgrading the CPU in my machine will lead to much better editing and exporting performance but more importantly better multitaking performance, which becomes more and more important as I delve into more area like streaming and advanced productivity and simulation work. I've considered the 5950X, but I got a deal on the 3950X and will wait until 5nm process comes around to upgrade again.
- Upgrading my 2070 Super to a 2080 Super. Upgrading my GPU comes along with similar benefits to my CPU, however with more of a focus on gaming performance which I expect to be of use when I stream from my new machine (considering doing Cities Skylines, Train Sim, and Transport Fever). Just like with the CPU, my GPU was determined through a good deal being available, and the fact that RTX 3000 GPUs still are not available at time of writing.
- Upgrading my Mic from a Blue Yeti to a Shure SM7B. Based on feedback I have received, audio quality is always a key concern from viewers - while the Blue Yeti IS a strong microphone, given how much my videos depend on my voice and voiceover work I do, I decided the investment in a pro quality mic made sense. This also would enable quality sufficient for podcasting in the future, something regularly suggested and which I am considering.
- Upgrading from . . . no laptop . . .to a functional laptop. Given the situation with the pandemic, I dumped my laptop long ago as a desktop is a far superior computing experience when at home. However, as various situations change and I have more opportunity to research videos "in the field", this will also hopefully enable a move to script more of my videos leading to higher quality overall, as well as more blog posts like the one you are reading right now!

In addition, I have some longer term plans for a bit more further equipment:

- While I did previously have a GH5 from Panasonic, and later a Sony A7III, I moved away from these large mirrorless cameras as I wasn't sure the value was there purely for talking heads videos (though it did make me look nice!). Moving forward as more video oppurtunities become available, reaquiring a mirroless camera may be a priority.
- Redundant equipment . . . some pieces of equipment I use frequently like my DJI Osmo Pocket are relatively inexpensive and aquiring a backup device makes sense. This is particularly important as I use my DJI Osmo Pocket in almost every video, creating quite the point of failure.

## The Various Processes

Now if you are new to YouTube or at least my YouTube, you may not be aware of the array of platforms where I have a presence. I manage social media / accounts on:

- YouTube (obviously)
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Patreon
- Redbubble

If you're not already, consider following me or supporting me on the various platforms I manage!

On top of this, the channel Discord also requires management and maintenance (and I spend a lot of time reading and replying to various things!) with over 300 members and a lot of activity!

For the aforementioned platforms I am responsible for creating: 

- Graphics, Videos, Posts, and Engagements (YouTube)
- Pictures and Posts (Instagram)
- Pictures, Posts and Comment Replies (Facebook)
- Tweets, Reading, and Replying to Various Threads (Twitter)
- Graphics, Videos, Posts, and Benefits Distribution (Patreon)
- Designing Merch (Redbubble)

This doesn't consider the sizeable amount of time I spend weekly keeping up to date with transit news and doing research (>20 hours), which also takes extra time to ramp up after a hiatus like the one I have recently taken.

Furthermore, there is a lot of "after video" work I do, I am not sure how common these practices are but I also:

- Track all video releases, subscriptions, video views, conversion rates, revenue, how similar channels are doing, my overall following, and future videos in a series of about 10 spreadsheets which take some time to keep maintained and updated.
- Backup and Organize video clips as I go, this helps me build up a good B-roll library, but since the majority of my saved content is in 4K, this requires working with multiple terabytes of data, which is currently backed up across 3 hard drives (soon to be 4), with planning underway to backup my video data to a cloud provider's service for redundancy and data security so that the channel could more easily recover from a disaster.
- Correspond and communicate with "stakeholders" for videos, Patrons / Passionate Fans and more. These folks are most invested in my videos and so they help guide the direction of the channel and future videos, however communications to take significant time.

## What about the videos!

Well, videos are coming! I can't spoil too much but, what I will say is that I currently plan on bringing back various series such as but, not limited to:

- Vehicles of Transit
- Station Focus
- Talking Transit with . . . 
- Demystified

I also have ideas for a few new series which I plan to introduce, not too much on that quite yet but stay tuned!

Of course, with my video release rate being relatively high (though it will need to ramp up from relaunch), it isn't practical to make videos all at once. Instead, I need to move them through a sort of production line system where in one day I may film video A, edit video B, make a thumbnail for video C, and release video D. This is what can enable releases as frequent as daily (though this is clearly not sustainable).

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this post on some of the various factors and considerations I have for restarting the YouTube channel - from the gear I have on hand, to the platforms I manage, to research and video production! If it seems like a lot to think about . . . it IS! But, I enjoy making transit and city videos and I think that producing them has serious positive effects and so I do it!

I hope you enjoy the channel relaunch, and stay tuned to the Blog too!
