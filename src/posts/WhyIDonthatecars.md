Welcome back to the website . . . that felt weird. I've long thought about talking more directly about cars and the place the automobile has in our world in the future if any. Stay tuned and you might learn a few things about me, as well as about cars.

## Cars and my Past

What many of my viewers and *readers* may not realize is that I have not been a transit user for my whole life. I grew up in a small suburb of Vancouver and unfortunately lived a pretty car filled life. While I did ride the Skytrain quite a lot I spent almost no time on buses before I reached high school. 

Of course this wasn't really because my parents hated transit. More, the case was I lived in places where transit was just not an option. This is an important point that cannot be overstated, people cannot ride transit that does not exist and its pretty hard to serve a lot of suburban and rural areas with high quality transit. To put it in perspective, in high school where I first regularly used transit I would have had to walk over an hour to get to a bus route that operated just a 30 minute service, and this route did not connect to the Skytrain or have many bus shelters which made it a nightmare when the weather was rainy. Of course there was another route which was only about half an hour away, but it ran a tiny van like bus and only arrived hourly when it was running on schedule which was very uncommon. 

So when I hit 17 (the age required to drive a car alone in British Columbia) I got my license almost immediately. I think this is a pretty usual response for young people who have never had access to transit and are sick of being immobile. It always makes me curious how independent young people can be when they have more access to mobility, I always found it interesting seeing youngsters on transit on my various travels and even on the subway in Toronto. With this in mind it is important to note that [over time we see less and less young people rushing out to get drivers licenses]([https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/the-decline-of-the-drivers-license/425169/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/the-decline-of-the-drivers-license/425169/)), which is great to see. I suppose this isn't too surprising as the world rapidly urbanizes and cars become less and less attractive for mobility. 

## Why not bike?

I'm sure you're wondering or screaming at your monitor if you are a cycling advocate, why not just bike? Well that is a good question . . . as it turns out distances were long enough that even cycling could take some time, but it wasn't necessarily impractical. Unfortunately a bigger issue was the lack of cycling infrastructure and speeding cars. No bike lanes, bike racks, and any destination cycling facilities made it unattractive as an option. Being able to get to a bus that wasn't very useful faster also wasn't that enticing.

## The unfortunate reality

While I am a huge advocate of transit, cycling and walking; there are a number of issues with them being practical purely based on distances in a lot of rural areas. Of course, there is lots we can work on to make rural areas and suburbs more sustainable but, don't forget that with limited dollars for transit we are limited in what we can do, and low hanging fruit from a population coverage and service quality perspective should generally be prioritized. This does leave us with a problem though, despite the trend to urbanization I think a significant amount of the population of North America is and continues to be poorly served by transit. We also have a massive sunk investment in a lot of car infrastructure (some of which can and should be converted into dedicated transitways and bike lanes). 

All this being said even if we had the money I feel at least in North America it would be a long time before significant transit service and infrastructure made sense in a *lot* of suburbs. Plus, even if we decided to do something like that we are facing issues such as climate change that cannot wait for such a drastic shift to occur.

## A pragmatic solution

So while transit and improved urban design (reducing distance to services and commercial areas) can play a large role, the reality is that North America has tons of cars and car infrastructure now and I think a policy of *harm reduction* is likely the best policy, so how do we do that . . .?

### First reduce car use on the whole

Policies like carbon and congestion pricing can help reduce car use and push drivers to use smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles. Congestion pricing can be targeted to push riders to use transit in core areas, and similar pricing can and should be applied to parking. You can also encourage those who are not directly served by high quality transit to drive to a park and ride site. Of course this is not ideal but, on the whole it reduces miles driven so I do see it as an improvement as long as you don't encourage more of the development that requires car parking at transit hubs. [See GO Transit in Ontario]([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-go-transit-calls-time-on-free-parking/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-go-transit-calls-time-on-free-parking/))

### Second, reduce the numbers for the worst types of private vehicles

Trucks and suvs which have become increasingly popular in North America take up more space when parked, emit more GHG's, damage the road more due to increased weight, and are a lot more dangerous for everyone due to a higher center of gravity and their large size. Reducing trucks and suvs could be done with a number of different policies. 

### Third, discourage car use during peak hours as with transit

Private and commercial vehicle traffic causing congestion makes road networks less effective for more efficient modes of transport like cycles and buses during peak hours and so just as with peak hour pricing on transit, road pricing can be adaptive to encourage use off peak. This can apply to parking as well.

### Fourth, reduce the impact of existing cars

A number of measures can help reduce the environmental impact of existing cars and road. These include:

- Policies which push for regular maintenance to maximize efficiency
- Carpooling and HOV lanes
- Keeping cars running longer by expanding regulation and technical standards
- Encourage the use of Hybrids
- Smart road network policies that strike a balance between reducing congestion and inducing demand
- Move to more permeable pavement and reduce run off from parking and roads
- Modify pavements to reduce the urban heat island effect

### Fifth, aggressively convert to electric cars both privately and for commercial use 

Electric vehicles are incredibly interesting to me and now living in BC I can really see how smart policies can encourage their use, BC has:

- Provided significant provincial subsidies, including extra subsidy for removing ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles from the road permanently
- Removed subsidies for *luxury* electric vehicles
- Expanded EV charging networks in population centers and along major highways to significantly reduce range anxiety
- Providing decals so EV users can use HOV lanes
- Provided subsidies to residents and business owners to install chargers
- Worked with BC Hydro (provincial electric utility) to promote EVs

I want to make a special note of points 2,3, and 5 here. By creating policies with a clear *visual* impact, more potential people can start to think about EVs, this is particularly important for charging which is often a particular concern to ICE drivers (despite the fact most charging will happen at home anyway). Having utilities involved is also very useful as in the long term, the significant battery capacity of EVs connected to the electrical grid could provide significant stability benefits, especially as solar and wind power grow in prominence.

 ## Conclusion

I am by no means a car lover, however I do think we need to be practical when reducing the harm cars do. Smart policies and regulation are far more likely to be implemented and effective than simple suggestions of "banning all cars". I do plan on talking more about urban mobility, urban planning and electric vehicles in the future so stay tuned to the channel and the site for more.
