Welcome back to the Website, a few days ago I completed my first of many "SkyTrain Walks", and I have some interesting results to report.

## The Route

For the walk I took the Canada Line to Olympic Village Station, one station I have only visited a handful of times, then after meeting up with a friend walked down Cambie all the way to Marine Drive Canada Line Station in South Vancouver, in the sidewalks on Cambie the entire way.

## Walk Results and Suggestions

The walk too a total of just 90 minutes which given the distance the Canada Line seems to cover felt quite fast, station spacings felt fairly large but, there are not actually that many stations I was passing by (just 4 actually) so the walk went by fairly quickly. 

The walk had sidewalks the entire way and despite it being a Saturday night things were never very busy, particularly for the portion of the line South of King Edward.

## Results and Observations

### Olymmpic Village

Starting from Olympic Village was a nice idea vs. Broadway City Hall as I had thought of doing earlier, as it let me see some more of the development around South False Creek as well as the short jog on Cambie North of Broadway. The type of development we are seeing around South False Creek is pretty neat especially coming from Toronnto - theres a lot of medium density and basically no hirises, which leads to a more "human scale" environment which I found quite pleasant to walk through. I really think having the Station at Olympic Village will be a big plus in the long run as more development fills in the areas around the station, along with Main Street this station really allows for excellent access to False Creek, though I do wish this station and Yaletown Roundhouse were a littl closer together, this would probably necessitate deeper stations at both locations but, I don't see that as a big access issue. It would also make the gap between Broadway City Hall and Olympic Village a little more logical, of course I also really lament the lack of a station further South on Granville between Vancouver City Center and Yaletown. I also want to note that this station is quite cool for its scale, it really is tiny with a small entrance and mostly narrow vertical access and yet it provides excellent service and passenger experience which really should be the number one priority when designing a station.

### Broadway City Hall

Once we get to Broadway City Hall you can really feel how wide Cambie is, even in this Northern Section. Its also somewhat surprising to me that we don't see more development around the Broadway City Hall Station entrance given how long it has been here and how important it will be especially once the Millennium Line extension opens. Again as I have said before though, it makes me even more dissapointed that we will not be seeing a second entrance in this station as it would clearly benefit from it. Around Broadway we see more of the samestyle of development that we saw closer to False Creek including some interesting developments which have townhomes on top of big box stores just North of Broadway. This style of development where you have townhomes fronting onto an elevated terrace is something I haven't seen a ton of outside of Vancouver and which I find quite cool, you get the townhome style living with more middle level densities which is a very interesting mix that works well in a medium density area such as this. As you continue South on Cambie the street starts to remind me a lot of Bloor or Danforth in Toronto with a sort of high street feeling with lots of small shops and services fronting the sidewalks, though similarly to those streets in Toronto I really wish we saw wider sidewalks and more calmed traffic on the street as things can feel crowded and having cars pass by at high speed certainly diminishes the experience walking along the corridor. Not long after passing Broadway we can see a mid rise building which houses King Edward Station (which is unique for it's stacked platforms) as well as the stations Bike Parkade. Up until now I have mostly been walking on the East Side of Cambie but, I cross to the West as Cambie stats to curve around Queen Elizabeth Park as this side of the road seems much more interesting. 

Stay tuned and keep in touch! Thanks for reading!
