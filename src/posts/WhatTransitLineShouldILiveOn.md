Welcome back! I am starting to get into a regular posting schedule for these posts and that excites me because it harkens back to my YouTube a bit - stay tuned on that today! Before I get started on today's discussion point, I want to give a big thanks to our website supporters who let us keep the site ad free, thank you!

## Maybe an LRT?

At some point in the past, it really felt to me like LRT was just one of the many options for rail transit that existed in Canada, however in recent years it has been astounding to see just how many LRT projects in Canada have come online - a number have opened in the past few years, more are currently under construction and even more lines and extensions are already under planning. For me, it really seems like at least for now most new rail transit in Canada is going to be LRT - Calgary Green Line, Edmonton Valley Line, Gatineau LRT, Quebec City LRT, Montreal’s LRTs, Ottawa LRT, Toronto LRTs, Mississauga LRT, and of course the Waterloo LRT. 

Now I’m also going to likely be eventually moving back to a transit accessible environment when the world re-normalizes so the question has arisen; “What type of transit line should I live on?” the answer is more complicated than you might expect, I'll go through some of my thoughts on living by the various transit modes and then of course on LRTs, so let's go!

## Options

Canada does not only have LRT based transit systems besides what you might think if you read my previous message, some cities like Toronto and Montreal seem to be embracing a hybrid approach where some major transit lines use metro technology and some use LRT technology, others (specifically Vancouver) have basically rejected LRT as an option for reasons I do not think are entirely justified, others still like Quebec City, Waterloo, and Calgary are going with a 100% LRT approach while of course smaller cities of which Canada has numerous are largely still operating as bus only systems.

### Buses

Living on a bus line is not something I am opposed to (clearly) but, it's also not the ideal form of public transit for heavy use as most will probably agree. While some rare BRT systems do take buses a long way I think the fundamental flaws are a bit too much to ignore. Buses especially low floor city transit buses tend to have pretty rough ride quality in my experience which makes riding on them for long periods of time less pleasant, buses also tend to sway a lot more in corners and have much stronger acceleration than trains which makes standing a pretty uncomfortable affair. There’s also the more minor issue of emissions, while thankfully most large Canadian cities are at least trialling electric buses and many have already implemented lower emissions buses with technology like CNG, the truth is that most of the time when riding a rail vehicle on Canada you have zero emissions all the way from the power plant to the vehicle which is a very nice feature for those who are environmentally conscious.

#### The Big Issue
For me though, buses have one major flaw which we still to this day do not talk about - permanence. The concept of permanence is that with a bus, it’s easy enough for a city to just stop running it if ridership is low, or reallocate some or all service hours to other busier routes down the line. Of course, this is probably unlikely in many cases - but unlikely things happen every day and having something as fundamental as a primary mode of mobility be pulled out from under you if times get tough is not a feeling I think many people like. That being said, permanence is also valuable in other ways. While a bus route is easy to change, if you live on an LRT Line you can be almost 100% sure that the tracks will not suddenly be rerouted a block or two over rendering your once short walk to transit a bit more annoying, and the same can be said for service frequency. When something like an LRT line is built, cities tend to open up more development opportunities near it which tends to drive more consistent and heavy ridership than even important bus lines and this in turn makes it a lot less likely that you’d see anything worse than a 15 minute service frequency at any time of the day -  which indeed is very rare for electrified rail in Canada, but not for bus routes.

So I think what’s clear is that for any place I would commit to living long term (let’s say 5+ years) it doesn’t really make sense to not live on a frequent rail line especially since with the addition of so many LRT’s Canada now has a total of 24 frequent electrified rail lines either existing or in construction, which means that there's actually a ton of options for places to live in close proximity to one of the hundreds of stations served by these lines. 

### Metros

Now of course, Canada has four “metro” style systems right now, and so the default question one might ask is - why settle for anything less? The truth is that this is a pretty strong point, but there are some flaws with living near the Metro Systems of big Canadian cities which are worth bringing up.

#### Flaws of Metros

Having now lived directly adjacent to metro systems in two of Canada’s largest cities for an extended period of time I have a few things to comment. 

The first flaw and biggest issue I see in Metro’s is also probably a strength in some places but in terms of being able to find a place to live, the massive amount of development drawn to stations can be both a blessing and a curse. While, this does mean there is often lots of choice in terms of accommodation there is also by default a lot more competition which means that you usually have to pay a lot, it also means that you may actually have to walk a lot farther than living near a station on a more minor transit line.

Another big disadvantage is the number of people at all hours of the day, while again this could be both blessing and curse - it could lead to some late nights at the hands of people out and about past midnight.

## LRT

So what are the Pros and Cons of living near an LRT line in particular? Well let's get the cons out of the way first . . . 

First of all pretty much universally LRTs get you less weather protection, than other rail transit, you might wonder why this matters from the point of view of where you live you might ask? Well good weather protection is something that will only get more important as the climate becomes less stable in coming years and decades, but also because it's a distinguishing factor from buses where you often get basically no protection from the elements, which can render using transit pretty unattractive is the weather is even just a little bad. 

Second, LRTs are by far mostly surface operating in Canada, this means that like with other above ground rail transit in Canada there's always a risk of loud noise, particularly as lines age and if you are near curves, which could be an important factor again if noise bothers you.

Third, LRTs lack grade separation most of the time, with flat intersections in most places, this isn't always a big deal but does like buses allow for policy creep if politicians suddenly decide transit is less important than the private car. It also means there may be less reliability if intersections and right of ways are not well designed.

Fourth, LRTs generally get worse service than Metros, now you might bring up the Eglinton or Ottawa LRTs in response to that but as I've mentioned in videos and some articles, these lines are more like oddball metro lines than true LRTs, which look more like what are typically called tramways in other countries. LRT service usually operates between every 5-15 minutes which while worse than Metros, is still pretty good in the grand scheme of things and should probably be more consistent than buses because . . . .

When compared to buses LRTs, get a *lot* more priority. When trains run on the street they basically universally get dedicated lanes, they often also have dedicated signals of various forms which allow them priority when they are at intersections. 

The next big benefit of LRT is the stability and gentle acceleration when compared to the bus. The improved ride quality when paired with more seating capacity means that there are options - you can often find a seat if you are looking for one and this is even more likely as people are more willing to stand since the trains are much smoother than a bus. 

Of course LRT is a term I lament and as I've already made clear in this post, not all LRTs are made equal. Though this means that there's potential for competition with the LRT space, a bit of a unique concept if you ask me . . . .

### LRT Implementations

The first major LRT implementation and what appears to be the most popular these days is the median LRT with traditional or priority traffic signals. This type of LRT is pretty great in dense areas however we seem to usually see them being built in low density suburbia which kind of just forces them into a role as a "better bus" since they can rarely reach high speeds they plog along and largely just provide a better ride and more capacity than buses they usually end up replacing. Living on one of these wouldn't necessarily be bad, but you've gotta make sure you are close to the stops you want to frequently use since travel times are likely to be slow. You've also got to factor in the potentially long wait for a train which isn't uncommon for LRT in general.

The second major implementation is the grade separated metro style LRT, this implementation which we see with the Ottawa O-Train and the Eglinton Crosstown in Toronto basically acts as a Metro with LRT vehicles I would probably avoid this type of LRT like the plague since it's kind of got the worst of both Metros and LRTs. It has the high prices of living near a metro, with the low capacity of an LRT which means these systems are likely going to be facing a lot of capacity and reliability issues long term (Ottawa already is).

The final implementation is a sort of hybrid regional rail and tram, sometimes best referred to as a tram train other times more like an S-Bahn. Some examples of these would be the Alberta LRTs and the Waterloo ION. In the Waterloo case the LRT operates along rail right of ways with crossing gates and higher sustained speeds in some areas, and in a median or single track split side of the road configuration in dense areas. This turns out to be a pretty effective way to design an LRT since the trains can really cover a lot of ground quickly in the less dense areas while also providing a lot of coverage with dense stops in the core areas. in the Alberta case the existing systems really feel like S-Bahns, both Edmonton and Calgary's LRTs have a shared section in the city section from which different lines branch out. At road crossings the LRTs basically universally have crossing gates as well which means that they get full priority over car traffic which means they can both operate at higher speeds but also with high frequencies, Calgary's LRT despite lacking any significant grade separation in much of the system operates at Metro Like frequencies in the peak. Living near and LRT like this really sounds like an ideal situation since you get the benefit of a Metro Like system in terms of speed and service frequency while still getting far more options for areas to live. 

### So many options . . .

With all the options for LRT systems I think it's more important than ever to think about which implementations of LRT exist and how they influence housing options nearby. We should also consider the interplay between the various transit modes and how we can make LRT or trams better by bringing in more of the positive elements of buses and metros.

## Why discuss where to live? 

I think moving around Vancouver and Toronto so much has really shown me what an impact location has on transit access as well as general quality of life. With everyone spending so much time at home, spaces which gave you a lot of access to a city at the cost of living space are looking a lot less attractive and I think remote work is something which will become a seriously important factor in the future especially in large cities, expect more posts on topics such as housing and transit access as well as the interplay of these topics with the changing way we are working in 2020.
