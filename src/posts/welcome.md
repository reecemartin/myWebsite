# Welcome to the Website!

Hi there! Wherever you found my website, whether it be through YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or good ol' Google Search I am happy you are here! So what do you have to look forward to here? Why did I make this website you ask . . . 

## The Rationale

As I have grown my online presence, largely on YouTube but, not entirely - I have realized that I am more or less at the mercy of the large social media companies on which I post my work largely in the form of videos. 

Of course I appreciate that websites and services such as those I use to both discuss and share my content exist, in the long term I think it is probably best to move away from them as they leave me with a lot of limitations and a certain long term "insecurity" that I do not like. 

Beyond that, I feel that most popular social media platforms these days are not great for long term article / blog style posts with some pictures sprinkled in and so I think, just making mine own website for that use case made the most sense. To be clear this is what I see being here: 

- Links to all of the platforms where I am currently active so you don't miss out on any videos or other content
- New reading content and articles on various topics from transit, to design, to technology
- Some more personal and anecdotal stuff that might not justify a video but, might still be of interest and which I would like to be more permanent than a social media post or a Discord message
- A hub for all my content covering it's full breadth, highlighting some of the work I am most proud of
- A place to explore content and ideas not necessarily connected to my core niche of transit, urban planning, and infrastructure
In the future an interactive map which shows relevant videos based on geographic location is something I am very interested in doing


## Why I started all this in the first place

Back a few years ago, I was thinking about my enjoyment of my local transit network the [Vancouver Skytrain](https://youtu.be/aLJOZesJmjE), when I saw a video from now infamous railway YouTuber [Geoff Marshall]([https://www.youtube.com/user/geofftech2](https://www.youtube.com/user/geofftech2)). Seeing how Geoff was making tons of videos about railways in the UK and London in particular, as well as the great success of those videos made me consider starting a YouTuber channel myself. 

Early on my channel was quite diversified and though I have removed most of the old videos I did everything from flyovers of famous cities and infrastructure, to videos on the future of transit systems, to surprisingly popular Computer Science tutorials. What became clear over time was that it would be wise to accept a niche and grow into that rather than necessarily expressing all my interests in one place. However, as time goes by I certainly want to expand my presence, both with deeper and longer form content on transit and urbanism but also, with topics such as technology!

Stay tuned to the website and come on this journey with me!
