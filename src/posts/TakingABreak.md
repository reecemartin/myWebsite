Welcome back to the Website or for many of you welcome to the website! I've been doing some posting here in the last little bit and will continue to ramp up posting as I ramp down YouTube video production. I've started getting a lot of comments and questions asking about the current situation so I thought I'd write a post adressing where things are and why I am making the changes I am making.

## What is up?

If you are a longtime follower of me or the channel you'll know I posted transit and urbanism videos very frequently for most of the past two years, this frequent posting as was addressed in a number of YouTube community posts lead to burnout a few times and so there were a couple longer hiccups in posting, sometimes for as long as a month. Currently, it's been about 2-3 weeks since I have posted a video and you can expect to wait a while longer for more videos, which will come eventually. The truth is, things have been rough my mental health has declined a lot with the constant pressure of YouTube but also because of a mismatch between the amount of work I had been putting in and the results I was seeing. My last video, a long form tour of the Vancouver SkyTrain required nearly 50 hours of work, but performed very poorly - the issue with this for me was seeing a video I was so happy with and so proud of not really connecting with my audience which kind of made me call into question how much my audience's reasons for watching my videos were in alignment with my reasons for making them.

This was somewhat exacerbated by some stuff that had been popping up on my Discord Server, to be clear I am happy to see a community sprung up around it, but it also lead me to realize a lot more of my viewers watch my videos purely because they think transit is cool and less because they care about the underlying social and environmental benefits or even in the high level political policies (less highways and roads and parking) that would actually lead to transit working better. While liking transit because you like buses, or liking transit because you like watching megaproject documentaries on Discovery Channel are totally valid reasons to like transit it made me feel I had lost my way in developing a core following that was really passionate about the confluence of urbanism, development, and transit systems.

## What was really up?

Beyond the dissapointment in seeing some of the fundamental foundation I had built the channel on wearing away, there was also the personal impact. While the burnout from spending 80+ hours every week for over two years, while being either a full time student or a full time employee was a big factor the endless comments and negative responses to my videos (even if they were a minority) really got to me. Some people say things like grow a thicker skin, but the truth is the annoyance and dissapointment is more around knowing I am attracting people who are either actively misinformed, or trying to misinform others or spin what I was trying to do with my comment into something it was not. I also think its certainly easier to say "just don't read the comments" or something to this tune, when you aren't constantly getting a myriad of comments, private messages, and emails directed at you some of which are insulting, some of which are kind, but all of which are very draining.

Theres also a very frustrating political orientation to transit which becomes very tiring. No matter what your opinion is, one side of the argument will call you a "shill" or a "sellout" to a political party. It's also very disheartening to see people all across the political spectrum opposing or supporting projects (see Toronto LRTs (bad), or Ontario Line (good)) just because it wasn't their favorite politician who proposed or supports it. These types of attitudes are very harmful to developing transit plans based on best practices and smart engineering and planning rather than at the whims of NIMBY's or others pushing a certain ideology.

Of course then there was the issue of uninformed comments and messages, maybe the worst. When people would comment or message me saying that I was unaware of something, or that I didn't know about a project that would change my opinion on something, or that since I didn't live somewhere or have a degree in a certain field, that I was not allowed to have an opinion or to make criticisms or share my support of a project. The truth is I am just another person on the internet sharing their knowledge, I am only special for having pretty extensive knowledge of the topics at hand, I have my blind spots but, often I come to unconventional conclusions and that doesn't mean I am unimformed, it probably just means I read the truth differently than others.

## What I enjoy!

Of course, YouTube is not just a miserable time for me! Theres a lot of things I love, visiting stations, exploring transit lines, looking at Google Maps on Discord Live Streams, meeting up with viewers who reach out to me, making videos (sometimes), reading kind and insightful comments, chatting on Discord and more! That's why I am refocusing things!

## What you can expect!

I will eventually get back to making videos, but they are unlikely to be frequent and they are unlikely to be anythign I am not super passionate about so you may see less international content and more focus on my local environment (wherever that is at the moment). I will be staying somewhat active on my Discord Server (though I am very busy these days and won't be replying to every thread despite wanting to) so you can expect to see short quips and other stuff shared on there sometimes. [You Can Join it Here](https://discord.gg/jfz3fqT). Most of my posting will likely move onto this website in the posts area which I have been preparing for some time now, feel free to like posts you enjoy but if you are really dying to comment you'll have to find another place to do it (though you can always reach out directly if need be). I hope to post at least once a week but, of course there are no gurantees and that will be dependent on how busy I am in a given week. You'll continue to see transit and urbanism content, but I might also post on my other interests as well (some of which may surprise you) - something which excites me deeply.

## How can you support me and connect?

If you want to connect, a direct message on Discord is 100% the best way to do so. However, you cant also find a contact form on this website if you wish to email. I love chatting with viewers / readers and so on definetly do this if you have any questions or if you just want to chat. While I have closed my Patreon because I will no longer be consistently posting video content, there are PayPal donation buttons you can use to support me in writing more and potentially producing more content in the future, I have chose this system because it is the most straightforward and doesn't require paying overhead to a middleman.

To be clear as mentioned above I am always down to meet up with viewers and or readers either to grab coffee or go for a walk along a transit line or interesting corridor or just to ride the SkyTrain around. Make sure to reach out if you're ever in Metro Vancouver!

Thanks for reading and thanks for the great years of support!
