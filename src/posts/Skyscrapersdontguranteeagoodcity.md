Welcome back to the website! A big shoutout to those who started helping to support the blog - it means a lot and helps pay for hosting and cloud services! I think over time you may very well see a reemergence of my YouTube Channel however, I find that through written media I can communicate much faster and with less fluff which makes it easier to cover ground and theres a lot of ground to cover!

## I thought skyscrapers and density were great for transit, and some look so architecturally stunning - why don't you like them!?

I forsee some readers taking the points I will make in this post so far and so I want to get it out of the way first: I *don't* hate or even actively  dislike Skyscrapers! I've spent the majority of the last 5 years of my life living in high rises or skyscrapeprs and theres lots to like! Great views, convenient apartments which are often affordable, lots to do in the dense immediate areas . . . 

Unfortunately though, I think much like with the camp of people who like subways for the sake of subways (maybe they just like trains), there is a sizeable camp of "skyscraperfans" who would be happy to see a skyscraper pop up just anywehere for the sake of it. I too appreciate the appearance and engineering of many tall structures just like I enjoy the engineering of rail lines, however we should not be making life altering city shaping decisions over an aesthetic whim. 

## Do you have examples of places where you think high densities have failed?

Why yes! I am glad you asked . . .

Toronto has a suprising number of places where it seems high density housing was juxtaposed into the regular suburbs with no special transit access provided (besides Toronto's unusually good buses), in most of these cases it seems that it would be almost universally better to replace these sets of highrises with better distributed density in the form of the mid-rises Toronto so sorely lacks. But, to be honest whats even more egregious to me are the high rise clusters that so often are marketed as "x's downtown" these clusters are often connected to the Toronto Subway, numerous buses and have lots of mixed uses and density and yet they fail what may be my favorite testt for what makes a city good - the pedestrian experience.

My first example of this type of environment is North York Centre or more specifically pretty much all of Yonge Street north of the 401 and into York Region, this area is very unique and unusual as it is basically a corridor full of highrise apartments as well as offices one block deep east and west of Yonge Street served by numerous bus routes and 3 subway stations as well as an incredible array of fantastic retail and food offerings. The area has all the ingredients for what could be an amazing pedestrian friendly city center and yet it fails massively in terms of pedestrian experience. 

For starters this "city center" like all the others in the Toronto area besides perhaps the region's actual downtown, prioritizes cars to an extreme level:

As you can see, this "downtown" has an insane 8 lane road that essentially acts as a highway through the core, car traffic is fast moving and most drivers disregard the posted speed limit (as usual) driving at whatever speed they see fit, while even more frightening some drivers treat the road with its widely spaced intersections and wide right of way like a drag strip to blast down in their pseudo race cars. 

Of course, theres also lots of space dedicated to drivers in the form of curbside parking which is ample and provides those with the means to afford a car far more space to park than pedestrians are granted on the narrow suburban width sidewalks.

Better yet, despite the endless transit access, numerous parking lots still run up against the main thoroughfare through North York Centre, the pedestrian experience could be improved massively if only the parking and store locations were swapped, but once again as with most of Toronto pedestrians are second class citizens and direct access for cars is the number one priority. You'll also notice a lot of the time these parking lots are empty and despite this you don't hear calls from city counsellors to remove them as feels inevitable for something like a bike lane.

The parking lots also do something else and thats heat the are up in summer and make things look like even more of a miserable hellscape in winter, this is not helped by the fact that these barely any plantings or greenery to speak of on the sidewalks of the area but, then again theres no room!

One final shot of the highway for good measure . . . 

Of course I should also mention that North York Centre has a lot of the other flaws of North American cities built into it as well. The signals for pedestrians are very short and require a jog just to clear before being levelled by a speeding driver, the roads and sidewalks are typically in rough condition, the bus stops feature little to no amenities - it is just incredibly hostile to anyone no located in a private autommobile . . . 

The scary part is that North York Centre is one of Toronto's *best* suburban city centres - they only get worse from here:

- Vaughan Metropolitan Centre: Weak Bus Service (pretty bus stops though, so um yay?), no 24 hour service despite being able to supposedly justify a massive BRT and Subway Station, big boz stores everywhere, parking lots taking up half the surface area etc.
- Missisauga Centre: Giant mall that closes at night is the CBD, no rail service for a few more years, no high order rail planned, tons of parking and wide streets
- Scarborough Centre: Another giant mall at the city center that is in desperate need up updating, no high order rail service, tons of surface parking and wide streets

## So how can we fix this?

Theres a number fo changes and paths with which we can start to "fix" Toronto's fundamentall broken suburban centres, I'll detail them here:

It should be an absolute priority that high density development is centered in these existing cores, ideally replacing the numerous surface parking lots. There should be more restrictions on building high rises outside of these transit hubs and where density is allowed we should increase the allowable height limits and densities. We should also work to incorporate more "missing middle" style housing on the peripherals of these centres with a transition from high to medium to low density rather than the insane status quo of single family housing abruptly transitioning into highrises.

Narrow streets and force through traffic to largely divert around centres, eliminate surface parking and largely eliminate undeground parking and parking minimums for many developments encouraging transit use to access these nodes. Encourage developments with reduced setbacks and have developers create more public amenities like wide sidewalks with increased landscaping and sidewalk fronting retail units.
