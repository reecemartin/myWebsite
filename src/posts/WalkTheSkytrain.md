Welcome back to the Website, today I'm going to be talking about my latest project which you could say is a "birthday gift to myself". The project wwhich I'm calling "Walk the SkyTrain" is a love letter to the Vancouver Rail Rapid transit system. 

## The Truth about Vancouver

The truth that annoys me to no end about Vancouver is that while I am quite comfortable and deeply familiar with the rail system itself, I am not very familiar with the surrounding areas, neighborhoods it passes through, and the street grids especially in Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver and Coquitlam. This is largely because as I mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.reecemartin.ca/posts/WhyIDonthatecars/), I grew up in a rural area with very little transit access, so when I WAS riding the SkyTrain it was usually to go to a central area. As you can see it wasn't all that long ago that even I held the belief that a system like the SkyTrain was largely just for people travelling from their miserable outlying homes to the lovely city center! 

Of course theres more to it than that, it's not like most people would casually get off at a random station on their commute and walk a few stations, as much as this is a GREAT thing to try. 

## Toronto, and Montreal

By the time I was starting to come to a realization of the error of my ways (largely thanks to the Canada Line) I was getting ready to move to Toronto for four years of university so things were not exactly looking up in terms of my knowledge of SkyTrain. If you are wondering why I bring up the Canada Line, its because unlike the Expo and Millenium Lines (ok mainly Expo Line) it follows a single corridor for most of its run through Vancouver, so I'm kind of instantly curious "What's going on above ground?", while the Expo Line does roughly follow Kingsway for a lot of it's length it really does not follow a single corridor so the curiousity did not really grow.

Now by comparison, in Toronto the Subway mostly does follow single corridors largely under major roads like Yonge, Sheppard and Bloor. One of the first things I did when visiting Toronto and attending UofT was riding all of the streetcars and walking along all of the core sections of the Subway. Not only did this really give me a sense for the stations and where they were but, it also gavee me a sense of the neighborhoods they were situated in and just how close together or far apart the stations were. I think this also addresses to an extent the sense some people in communities get (especially those who disagree with you) that as a rapid transit rider you just travel under their neighborhood and as with a flyover territory you have no real sense what things are like on the ground.

Throughout my time in Toronto, I had the pleasure of walking the entire length of the Bloor Danforth Line in sections, riding every streetcar line from end to end, and walking the entire length of the Sheppard and Yonge Lines. I do want to mention that walking the length of the Yonge Line is not for the faint of heart as despite what donwntown dwellers might think, Toronto has a LOT of hills and valleys, I remember once walking from the Lakeshore all the way to Cummer along Yonge one cold February evening and it was definetly an experience. 

Of course walking these streets is more than just getting the experience of walking the subway routes, through doing it I learned about what are some of my favorite areas of Toronto on Yonge and the Danforth to this day, and I saw plenty of interesting station buildings, emergency exits and more than most subway riders probably don't even realize exist. 

Once I had experienced the benefits of "Walking the System", I made sure I did it in Montreal the next time I visited as well, now the Montreal Metro is a little less exact in following road corridors but, the experience of walking the Blue and Green Lines, and the portions of the Orange Line on the island of Montreal was super rewarding and an experience I will not soon forget.

## Ok, so what about Vancouver?

Now, I'm sure you can tell my plan is to do just this for Vancouver! I think I can cover nearly the whole SkyTrain system over the next year and my plan will be to document it as I go with posts incuding interesting things I notice, photos and the like! My plan is to start with sections of the system I have never walked around, so a lot of the Canada Line and much of the Expo Line will probably be among the first sections I try! 

Stay tuned and keep in touch! Thanks for reading!
