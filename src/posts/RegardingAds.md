You might have noticed intermittent ads on this website while browsing the posts page or specific posts, but this is changing starting from today: 
From now on, our website will be supported entirely by our generous supporters, and you won't be interrupted by ads while reading anymore!
We wanted to thank our generous supporters on Paypal, and all our past Patreon supporters that have been with us for a long time. 
If you would like to support us, you can do so through [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=867U3N8UJHJB6&currency_code=CAD&source=url), and you can also get on our mailing list through [this link](https://forms.gle/dzjghTCihUAJsfxE6). 
Cheers and happy reading!
